To reflect both the local context and the interdisciplinary nature of the model, we refer to the developed agent-based model as LUNTIAN — an acronym for Labor, UNiversity, Timber Investment, and Agent-based Nexus. The name emphasizes the model’s core components: the roles of labor dynamics (community and institutional), the university as resource manager, and the investment-driven nature of industrial timber operations. "Nexus" captures the interconnected biophysical and socio-economic processes that characterize the modeled socio-ecological system. Additionally, "luntian" is a Filipino word meaning "green," symbolizing the model's focus on sustainability and forest regeneration within the Philippine context.

The design of the LUNTIAN model is grounded in the specific socio-political and ecological context of the UP LLG. It was developed in alignment with the official proposal and implementation strategy led by the University of the Philippines. As such, the modeler operates within the boundaries defined by the institution’s objectives and governance framework, and does not intervene in ongoing land tenure disputes or political conflicts. The model does not aim to resolve issues of land ownership or access. Instead, it serves as a simulation framework for analyzing the university’s proposed approach to ITP development—focused on ecological viability, investment management, and possible labor integration.
