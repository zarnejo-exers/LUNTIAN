# LUNTIAN — Agent-Based Model for Laguna Land Grant Case Study

## Overview  
**LUNTIAN** (Labor, UNiversity, Timber Investment, and Agent-based Nexus) is an agent-based model designed to simulate an Industrial Tree Plantation (ITP) embedded in a socio-ecological system. Its name reflects the model’s core components — labor dynamics (community and institutional), a university as resource manager, investment-driven timber operations — and their ecological nexus. “Luntian” means “green” in Tagalog, symbolizing the model’s emphasis on sustainable forest regeneration within its Philippine context.  

The model does **not** aim to resolve land-tenure disputes or political conflict. Instead, it provides a simulation framework for assessing ecological viability, investment management strategies, labor integration, and potential outcomes of ITP development under different scenarios.

LUNTIAN is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners interested in:  
- the interplay between socio-economic and ecological processes in plantations;  
- effects of labor decisions, investment strategies, and institutional management on forest sustainability;  
- scenario analysis (e.g. harvesting regimes, labor policies, investment options);  
- understanding trade-offs between profitability and ecological preservation in tree plantations.
